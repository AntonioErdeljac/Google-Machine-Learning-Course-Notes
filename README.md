* [Framing](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/Google-Machine-Learning-Course-Notes/wiki/%231-Framing)
    * In this section we learn the basics of Machine Learning Terminology
* [Descending into Machine Learning](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/Google-Machine-Learning-Course-Notes/wiki/%232-Descending-into-Machine-Learning)
    * In this section we work with linear regression, learn about MSE, loss caculation and the basics of how training a model works
* [Reducing Loss](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/Google-Machine-Learning-Course-Notes/wiki/%233-Reducing-Loss)
   * In this section we explore loss reduction methods by explaining gradient descent, batches, iterative learning and other effective learning methods
* [First Steps With Tensorflow](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/Google-Machine-Learning-Course-Notes/wiki/%234-First-Steps-With-TensorFlow)
   * In this section we learn the basics of TensorFlow and Pandas. Through practices linked we develop our own linear regression code
